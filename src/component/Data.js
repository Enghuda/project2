    "desc":"Rakotz Bridge is so pretty it could perhaps more aptly be called “fairy-tale bridge”. But its name, which means Devil’s Bridge, comes from its supernatural associations. The looping structure, in the German town of Kromlau, forms a perfect circle with its watery reflection – a clever trick of engineering that some see as otherworldly.",

  "desc":"As synonymous with mystery as Venice is with canals, the Bermuda Triangle – covering around 500,000 square miles between Bermuda, Miami in Florida and San Juan in Puerto Rico – has seen more than 20 planes and 50 ships crash with no obvious explanation and even some “vanish” completely. Theories range from suggestions of supernatural activity to the more logical hypotheses that it’s down to magnetic compass variation or rogue waves.",

  "desc":"Pretty much any forest can feel eerie when there’s no one else around and the trees are clung with mist. But Hoia-Baciu dials up the strangeness with crooked trees that twist and turn, as if frozen in dance. Legends tell of alien encounters and people vanishing in the woods (it’s been dubbed “the Bermuda Triangle of Romania”). The biggest mystery of all is The Clearing, a central area where nothing grows – and no one, yet, knows why.",

  "desc":"Its milky turquoise waters may look inviting for a swim, but don’t jump in – this caldera, formed in the crater of the Kawah Ijen volcano, is the world’s largest acidic lake. The electric blue flames that burst into the air are a source of fascination, though (of course) there is a scientific explanation: high levels of sulfuric acid, which give the water its striking hue, combust when they hit the air.",

  "desc":"Most of the year, this reservoir in western Alberta is an attractive body of water backed by part of the Canadian Rockies. In chillier months it transforms into a magical winter wonderland when what appear to be Christmassy baubles or snowballs form beneath the surface. The truth is less romantic, as the suspended white orbs are pockets of methane gas formed when organic matter decomposes and is frozen into clumps.",

  "desc":"Ancient Maori legend says these boulders are gourds or food containers, washed ashore from the wreckage of a canoe that brought their ancestors to New Zealand’s South Island. Another theory suggests they are alien eggs. Geology says they formed in sediment on the sea floor around 65 million years ago, eventually choosing Koekohe Beach as their home.",
